Library that allows to setup a number of https://github.com/liferay[Liferay] artifacts in the DB. It uses xml and https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/javadocs/portal-kernel[Liferay APIs] to add all configured artifacts.

== Usage

We recommend using Liferay's link:https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/data-frameworks/upgrade-processes.html[upgrade process] or control panel portlet to apply declared database changes.

=== Configuration header
All data definitions in the setup XML file are applied according to the `configuration` header. The header defines:

. the link:https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/configuring-liferay/virtual_instances.html[virtual instance] on which the library will modify the data.
. admin user account to be used for data modification

.Automatically selected admin user

=== Features

==== Service Access Policy
link:https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/securing-liferay/securing-web-services/setting-service-access-policies.html#[Service access policy] is a link:https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/securing-liferay/securing-web-services.html[second] from four of Liferay's API security layers. Together with _IP Permission Layer_, _Authentication and verification layer_ and _User permission layer_ is responsible for securing access to web services provided by portal instance.

If you develop new link:https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/headless-delivery/apis-with-rest-builder.html[REST Builder] REST/GraphQL endpoint's it's a common requirement to setup an access for those API's for an unauthenticated portal user- Guest which is by default forbidden.

=== Setup guide

. Install the `com.ableneo.liferay.db.setup.core-{current-db-setup-core-version}.jar` bundle in `${liferay.home}/osgi/modules`
. Prepare your own bundle that uses the library as a `provided`/`compileOnly` dependency. For example:
+
.build.gradle
[subs=attributes+]
```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'com.ableneo.liferay:com.ableneo.liferay.db.setup.core:{current-db-setup-core-version}'
}
```
+
.pom.xml
[subs=attributes+]
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ableneo.liferay</groupId>
    <artifactId>com.ableneo.liferay.db.setup.core</artifactId>
    <version>{current-db-setup-core-version}</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

. Prepare xml data configuration. Documentation sits directly in the link:src/main/resources/setup_definition.xsd[setup_definition.xsd] file.
+

.Example configuration: setup.xml

----
. Load the XML setup file and run `setup` method on it:
+
[source, java]
----
URL resource = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(path);
InputStream setupFile = Objects.requireNonNull(resource, "XML Liferay DB setup file not found in classpath.").openStream();
Setup setup = MarshallUtil.unmarshall(setupFile);
boolean setupSuccess = LiferaySetup.setup(setup);

=== Liferay Portal requirements

The code is compatible with *Liferay Portal {liferay-version}*. Other versions that have been or are supported:

. https://github.com/ableneo/liferay-db-setup-core/tree/7.3.5[Liferay Portal EE/CE 7.3.5]
. https://github.com/ableneo/liferay-db-setup-core/tree/b0d4e1d602015b704218c5511277bc87dc7eb9c7[Liferay Portal EE/CE 7.1.2]
. https://github.com/ableneo/liferay-db-setup-core/tree/1.x[Liferay Portal EE/CE 6.2.5 and higher]

== Roadmap

* more tests
* project integration with lundegaard fork: https://github.com/lundegaard/liferay-db-setup-core, until than changes and fixes from lundegaard fork will be ported to the library

== Motivation

We use https://github.com/liferay[Liferay] as an application building platform.

Portlets, content and permissions, in short- *data* serve as a building block of a web application with consistent portal UX. In the use case the *data* play important role in application building, greatly influencing UX.

By storing the application *data* as XML declaration we enable developers to version and progress *data* development as if it was a *code*. All standard development practices like versioning, code review, building and deployment can be applied to the Liferay *data as code*.

They are probably not perfect, please let me know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

==== Refactorings & project changes
* version changed from 4 to 3 numbers, build version will increment every time there is a new feature or bugfix
* improved docs

=== Version 7.3.6.0

==== Features & bug fixes
* Bumped target Liferay Portal version to minimum 7.3.6 ga7.
* Improved category/vocabulary idempotency, it's possible to update categories and vocabularies with optional uuid, before categories/vocabularies were identified only by name. That allows to update a category name which wasn't possible before.
* Improved categories/vocabulary updates performance, update is only issued if anything in the definition differs compared to the data in the DB.
* Category by_name search is scoped only to a particular vocabulary.
* Added property element in categories that allows to define AssetCategoryProperty. These are identified by a key. 
+
TIP: TODO: deletion of existing property.

==== Refactorings & project changes
* divided xsd to "elements" and "types" parts, replaced many element references with types which improves naming flexibility
* every xsd type follows is camel cased and suffixed with word: Type, e.g. UuidType
* simplified dependency management with `release.portal.bom`
* removed `shade` maven plugin as portal exports `com.liferay.portlet.asset.util` package already in `org.eclipse.osgi_3.13.0.LIFERAY-PATCHED-11` bundle
