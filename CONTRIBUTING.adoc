= Thank you for considering contribution!

== TL;DR

. find issue for the problem
. if not found create one
. work or wait :)

== Detail

In case of missing feature or a bug. Before doing anything else, please check if there is an open issue for the problem you've spotted. If not, please create an issue. The issue will be used as a mean of tracking discussion/documentation about the problem even if you'll fix it yourself.

Please link the issue in commit messages, as an example here is a commit message that references issue #1:

`fix broken feature #1`

I recommend https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[the very good guide] on writing best commit messages.

== Code formatting

To ease merging pains please use prettier formatting included in maven project.

To check if your formatting is ok run:
```bash
mvn prettier:check
```

To reformat all the source run:
```bash
mvn prettier:write
```
