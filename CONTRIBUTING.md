# Thank you

# TL;DR

1. find issue for the problem
1. if not found create one
1. work or wait :) 

# Detail
In case of missing feature or a bug. Before doing anything else, please check if there is an open issue for the problem you've spotted. If not, please create an issue. The issue will be used as a mean of tracking discussion/documentation about the problem even if you'll fix it yourself.

Please link the issue in commit messages, as an example here is a commit message that references issue #1:

```fix broken feature #1```

I recommend [the very good guide][1] on writing best commit messages.
